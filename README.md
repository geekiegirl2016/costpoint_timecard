This script will log into Costpoint, go to the Timecard Application within, and add estimated hours to your timecard. 

Then all you have to do is have windows run it a couple times a day and you are good to go!

Just check your email every so often and see that it ran and updated your timecard. 

Please note that you must ensure that you do not fraudulently enter time. If you take PTO or have Holiday, you must make sure you update your estimated hours.
